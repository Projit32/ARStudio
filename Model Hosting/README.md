# Setting up your Dev Channel

**If you're using the app from PlayStore:**

1. You need a hosting service. For that you can use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [000Webhost](https://www.000webhost.com).
you can use services like AWS, Hostinger or GoDaddy, bt they are all paid and not so easy to use. I recommend **000webhost** for this purpose. 
2. setup your hosting platform.
  - If you're using **XAMPP**, simply install the applicaation and grant all firewall permission,if prompted, for public and private network, you'll need it.
  - if you're using **000webhost**, sign up for a free account and register a website. Skip the tutorial by presing `It's not my first rodeo, take me to the cPanel`. 
    Register a name & a password for your website.
3. Download both the scripts from the `ARSR` folder.
  - **XAMPP ** : wherever you have installed xampp, there will be a folder inside the xampp folder named as `htdocs`, i.e `xampp/htdocs`. Create a folder named as **ARSR**
  and cut-paste both the scripts in it. Lastly, create two folders named as **objects** and **AnimatedObjects** inside the `ARSR` folder.
  - **000webhost** : Rightnow, it will show you 3 options. Choose `upload your site`. Inside the `public_html` folder, add a folder namd as **ARSR**, inside which you'll
  nned to create two more folders named as **objects** and **AnimatedObjects**. Now, in that same folder, that is the **ARSR** folder, upload the scripts that you have downloaded
  earlier.
4. Finally, the fun part. you can browse through sites like [Google Poly](), [SketchFab]() or [](), to find 3D models that suits your needs. Just be sure that you download it in
`GLTF` format.
